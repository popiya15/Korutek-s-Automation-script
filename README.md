This repository contains the custom Deluge functions and workflow scripts developed for the Zoho CRM implementation project at Korutek Engineering. The scripts were designed to automate repetitive tasks, reduce manual errors, and align Zoho CRM with Korutek’s sales workflow. They represent the practical outputs of the project and serve as technical evidence of the system configuration described in the coursework report.
Usage

The scripts are written in Zoho Deluge and can be deployed within Zoho CRM by:

Creating Functions and attaching them to Workflow Rules or Buttons

Configuring Schedule Triggers for reminders

Mapping fields (e.g., Leads, Enquiries, Lead Source) to Korutek’s modules

⚠️ These scripts are designed specifically for Korutek Engineering’s CRM structure and may require adaptation for other contexts.
